        <p>
          STABLU Sci-Tech is a cross functional team both engineering skills and
          social skills. However, STABLU is working on two main projects called
          High Tech Product(HTP) and Low Tech Product(LTP). The HTP is
          concentrating on more sophisticated problems and needs higher
          technology solutions. Currently, STABLU has been developing IoT
          Solutions for applying in Energy Sector, to reduce the initial cost,
          time, and maximize efficiency and energy-saving. Our goal is to
          provide simple but effective solutions for enabling the possibility of
          clean and renewable energy for everyone. Meanwhile, STABLU is also
          working on developing LTP solutions for solving the real-life problem
          which does not require high technology. LTP project has one main
          objective is to enable and open a window, the opportunity for
          technology enthusiasts, makers, creators, innovators, and DIY-er
          building or creating the solutions for real-life problems and for
          people who need them.
